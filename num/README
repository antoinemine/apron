This small package, only composed of header files, is used to offer a generic
interface to different numbers representation. It took its inspiration from
pk_int (integers in Newpolka library from Bertrand Jeannet) and oct_num
(integers in Octagon Abstract Domain library from Antoine Miné).

It requires the GMP and MPFR libraries, and GNU sed.

It may be freely distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the LGPL
license.

INSTALLATION
============
- make all
- make install
- make clean
- make distclean
... (look at the Makefile)
Several .h files are generated using GNU sed from _tmpl.h.
Also many .h files have a corresponding _def.h file.

USE
===
Look in the Makefile how test.c can be compiled with different number types.

Numbers
=======

The main files to be included are numXXX.h. 

They defines types numXXX_t and operations numXXX_op. 
Generic signature is available in comments in num_types.h.
XXX can be:
- Il	 long int
- Ill	 long long int
- MPZ	 mpz_t (GMP library)

- Rl     rationals using long int
- Rll	 rationals using long long int
- MPQ	 rationals using mpq_t (GMP library)
     Also defines type numintXXX_t (the underlying integer types).

- D      double
- Dl	 long double
- MPFR   floating-point of arbitrary precision (MPFR library)

Bounds
======

Bounds are *superior* bounds defined on top of num_t. They add +oo to num_t.
The main files to be included are boundXXX.h and boundXXX_conv.h
Generic signature is available in comments in bound_types.h.
