@chapter Introduction to APRON
@c *******************************************************************

The APRON library provides a common interface for @emph{abstract
domains of invariants} for numerical variables, in the sense of the
Abstract Interpretation theory. It includes a few domains, and
provides interfaces to libraries implemented by other teams.

@c The APRON library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical
@c variables of a program by Abstract Interpretation. The aim of such an
@c analysis is to infer invariants about these variables, like
@c @math{1<=x+y<=z}, which holds during any execution of the program.
@c Such an analysis works by computing iteratively the solution of
@c fixpoint equations on an @emph{abstract domain} of invariants. The
@c result is a overapproximation of the least inductive invariant of the
@c program.

Several libraries already exists, wich implement various abstract domains of
invariants.  One can cite intervals, linear equalities, octagons,
octahedra, convex polyhedra, polynomial equalities, polynomial
inequalities. Although they offer a kernel of common functionalities,
their API may differ greatly, and some functionalities may lack in some
libraries. The aim of the APRON library is to offer a common interface to these
libraries. Such a standardized interface offers several advantages: it allows
@itemize
@item to easily
substitute a library/abstract domain by another in the same analysis
tool; this is useful to compare the efficiency of 2 implementations of
the same abstract domain, or the precision of 2 different abstract
domains.
@item
to factorize services which are mostly independant of the abstract
domain (variables management, linearization of non-linear expressions,
etc...);
@item
to make easier the combination of abstract domains: the abstract
domains to be combined are used through the same interface, as the
resulting combination;
@end itemize

@subsubheading As a user, why should I use APRON ?
@enumerate
@item
it makes very easy to switch the abstract domain (for numerical
variables) in use in an analyzer;
@item
it already offers the most used abstract domains, ranging from
intervals, octagons, convex polyhedra to linear congruences;
@item
its interface should satisfy most needs, as it already satisfies the
members of the APRON project working in different contexts
(verification of high-level specifications/programs with exact
arithmetics for INRIA \& Verimag, static analysis of runtime errors
with floating-point arithmetics for ENS Paris, automatic
parallelization of programs for ENSMP).
@item
the interface, at the level 1, already provides slightly higher-level
functionalities than most existing and publicy available abstract
domains libraries (with the manipulation of environments); this
statement should be reinforced in the near future with the planned
addition of a generic non-linear expressions layer and a
floating-point arithmetic layer.
@end enumerate

@subsubheading As a domain implementor, why should I interface my abstract domain/library to APRON ?
@enumerate
@item to incite existing users of the APRON interface to try your library;
@item to make your users, including yourself, benefit from previous points 1 and 4;
@item
to not waste your time implementing environments, variables renaming,
OCaml interfaces, and so on; the effort to connect your library to the
interface should at minimum be counterbalanced by such gains;
@end enumerate


@c The contributions of the project are
@c @itemize
@c @item
@c The identification of the basic functionalities that an implementation
@c should provide, and which cannot be factorized at a higher level;
@c @item
@c The design of a detailed API (datatypes, functions signatures)
@c @item
@c The implementation of functions that will be needed for most implementations
@c @item
@c The design and implementation of higher level services that are built on
@c top of the basic interface and that factorizes services that can be
@c shared between the underlying implementations.

@subsection C Headers and Libraries
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

Declarations needed to use an underlying library via APRON are
collected in the C include files @file{ap_global0.h} and
@file{ap_global1.h}. They respectively refer to the level 0 and the
level 1 of the interface. One can also refer to single APRON modules
with their corresponding include files @file{ap_dimension.h},
@file{ap_lincons0.h}, ... Header files @file{<stdio.h>},
@file{stdlib.h} and @file{<stdarg.h>} will be required.

Then, you should also include the header files of the underlying
libraries you want to use via APRON (for instance, @file{box.h},
@file{pk.h}, @file{ap_ppl.h}).

All programs using APRON must link against the @file{libapron},
@file{libmpfr} and @file{libgmp} libraries, and the underlying
libraries you want to use via APRON:
@enumerate
@item
If some file @file{test.c} uses the POLKA library via APRON, the
compilation command should look like @samp{gcc -I$ITV/include
-I$MPFR/include -I$GMP/include -I$APRON/include -L$MPFR/lib
-L$GMP/lib -L$APRON/lib -o test test.c -lpolkaMPQ -lapron -lmpfr -lgmp},
assuming that the POLKA library is used in
its 'MPQ' version (internal number representation is GMP rationals) and
resides in @file{$APRON/include} and @file{$APRON/lib} directories.

The @file{libpolkaMPQ.a} library is of course needed,
@file{libapron.a} contains all the code common to all APRON library
(manipulation of expressions, environments, ...), as well as ITV
functions (quasi)linearisation facilities of APRON,...), last the
libraries @code{libmpfr.a} and @code{libgmp.a} are required both by
@sc{NewPolka} and @sc{APRON} .
@item
If some file @file{test.c} uses the PPL library via APRON, the
compilation command should look like @samp{g++ -I$ITV/include
-I$MPFR/include -I$GMP/include -I$APRON/include -I$PPL/include
-L$ITV/lib -L$MPFR/lib -L$GMP/lib -L$APRON/lib -L$PPL/lib -o test
test.c -la_ppl -lppl -lgmpxx -lapron -lmpfr
-lgmp}, assuming that PPL resides in $PPL and PPL APRON interface in
@file{$APRON/include} and @file{$APRON/lib} directories.

Notice that the PPL library (@file{libppl.a}) is a C++ library, you
need to use @samp{g++} instead of @samp{gcc} for linking. You also
need the C++ layer on top of GMP (@file{libgmpxx.a}). The
@file{libap_ppl.a} library contains the layer on top of PPL which
implements the APRON interface.

@item
If a C file @file{test.c} uses the PPLite library via APRON,
the compilation command should look like @samp{g++ -I$ITV/include
-I$MPFR/include -I$GMP/include -I$APRON/include -I$PPLITE/include
-I$FLINT/include -L$ITV/lib -L$MPFR/lib -L$GMP/lib -L$APRON/lib
-L$PPLITE/lib -L$FLINT/lib -o test test.c
-lap_pplite -lpplite -lflint -lgmpxx -lapron -lmpfr -lgmp},
assuming that PPLite resides in $PPLITE and PPLite APRON interface in
@file{$APRON/include} and @file{$APRON/lib} directories.

Notice that the PPLite library (@file{libpplite.a}) is a C++ library,
you need to use @samp{g++} instead of @samp{gcc} for linking.
You also need the C++ layer on top of GMP (@file{libgmpxx.a}).
The @file{libap_pplite.a} library contains the layer on top of PPLite
which implements the APRON interface.
@end enumerate
You should look at the specific documentation of the libraries for
more details.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node C Naming conventions, Allocating managers and setting options, C Headers and Libraries, C Programming Guidelines
@subsection Naming conventions and Allocation/Deallocation schemes
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

The general rule is that all type and function names defined by the
library are prefixed with @code{ap_}, in order to prevent name
conflicts with other libraries. Moreover, functions operating on
objects of type @code{ap_typ_t} are usually prefixed with
@code{ap_typ_op}.

Given an object of datatype @code{ap_typ_t*}, two kinds of allocation/deallocation pairs of functions may be defined:

@enumerate
@item
variable declaration: @code{ap_typ_t obj;}
@itemize
@item Initialization:
@code{void typ_init(ap_typ_t* arg, ...)} or @code{ap_typ_t ap_typ_make(...)}
@item Finalization:
@code{void ap_typ_clear(ap_typ_t* arg)}
@end itemize
this pair of functions follows the semantics used in the GMP
library. The first function initializes the object of type
@code{ap_typ_t} pointed to by @var{arg}, and fills it with a valid
content. The second function deallocates the memory possibly pointed
to by fields of the object @code{*arg}, but do not attempt to
deallocate the memory pointed by @var{arg}.
@item
variable declaration: @code{ap_typ_t* obj;}
@itemize
@item Allocation
@code{ap_typ_t* ap_typ_alloc(...)}
@item Deallocation
@code{void ap_typ_free(ap_typ_t* arg)}
@end itemize
the first function allocates an object of type @code{typ_t} and then
calls a @code{ap_typ_init}-like function on the result; the second
functions first call a @code{ap_typ_clear}-like function and then
deallocate the memory pointed by @var{arg}.
@end enumerate

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Allocating managers and setting options, Sequel of the small example, C Naming conventions, C Programming Guidelines
@subsection Allocating managers and setting options
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

From the user point of view, the benefit of using the APRON interface
is to restrict the place where the user is aware of the real library
in use to the code initializing the manager, as illustrated by the
following example:
@example
#include "ap_global1.h"
#include "pk.h"

/* Allocating a Polka manager, for polyhedra with strict constraints */
manager_t* man = pk_manager_alloc(true);
/* Setting options offered by the common interface,
   but with meaning possibly specific to the library */
manager_set_abort_if_exception(man,EXC_OVERFLOW,true);
@{
  funopt_t funopt;
  funopt_init(&funopt);
  funopt.algorithm = 1; /* default value is 0 */
  manager_set_funopt(man,fun_widening,&funopt); /* Setting options for widening */
@}
@{
  funopt_t funopt = manager_get_funopt(man,fun_widening);
  funopt.timeout = 30;
  manager_set_funopt(man,fun_widening,&funopt);
@}
/* Obtaining the internal part of the manager and setting specific options */
pk_internal_t* pk = manager_get_internal(man);
pk_set_max_coeff_size(pk,size);
@end example
The standard operations can then be used and will have the
semantics defined in the interface. Notice however that some
generic functions are not formally generic: @code{abstract_fprint},
@code{abstract_fdump}, @code{abstract_approximate}.
At any point, options may be modified in the same way as during
the initialization.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Sequel of the small example, Typing issue in C, Allocating managers and setting options, C Programming Guidelines
@subsection Sequel of the small example
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
An environment can be created as follows:

@smallexample
/* Create an environment with 6 real variables */
ap_var_t name_of_dim[6] = @{
  "x","y","z","u","w","v"
@};
ap_environment_t* env = ap_environment_alloc(NULL,0,name_of_dim,6);
@end smallexample

Then, we build an array of constraints. At level 1, an array of
constraints is an abstract datatype, which requires careful
manipulation w.r.t. memory management.

@smallexample
/* Create an array of constraints of size 2 */
ap_lincons1_array_t array = ap_lincons1_array_make(env,2);

/* 1.a Creation of an inequality constraint */
ap_linexpr1_t expr = ap_linexpr1_make(env,AP_LINEXPR_SPARSE,1);
ap_lincons1_t cons = ap_lincons1_make(AP_CONS_SUP,&expr,NULL);
    /* Now expr is memory-managed by cons */
/* 1.b Fill the constraint */
ap_lincons1_set_list(&cons,
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT,"x",
		     AP_CST_S_FRAC,1,2,
		     AP_END);
/* 1.c Put in the array */
ap_lincons1_array_set(&array,0,&cons);
    /* Now cons is memory-managed by array */

/* 2.a Creation of an inequality constraint */
expr = ap_linexpr1_make(env,AP_LINEXPR_SPARSE,2);
cons = ap_lincons1_make(AP_CONS_SUPEQ,&expr,NULL);
    /* The old cons is not lost, because it is stored in the array.
       It would be an error to clear it (same for expr). */
/* 2.b Fill the constraint */
ap_lincons1_set_list(&cons,
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT,1,"x",
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT,1,"y",
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT,1,"z",
		     AP_END);
/* 2.c Put in the array */
ap_lincons1_array_set(&array,1,&cons);
@end smallexample

Last we can build an abstract value.

@smallexample
/* Creation of an abstract value defined by the array of constraints */
ap_abstract1_t abs = ap_abstract1_of_lincons_array(man,env,&array);

fprintf(stdout,"Abstract value:\n");
ap_abstract1_fprint(stdout,man,&abs);
@end smallexample

We  now deallocate everything:

@smallexample
/* deallocation */
ap_lincons1_array_clear(&array);
ap_abstract1_clear(&abs);
ap_environment_free(env);
ap_manager_free(man);
@end smallexample

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Typing issue in C,  , Sequel of the small example, C Programming Guidelines
@subsection Typing issue in C
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of several libraries at the same time via the common
interface and the managers associated to each library raises the
problem of typing. Look at the following code:

@example
ap_manager_t* manpk = pk_manager_alloc(true); /* manager for Polka */
ap_manager_t* manoct = oct_manager_alloc();    /* manager for octagon */

ap_abstract0_t* abs1 = ap_abstract_top(manpk,3,3);
ap_abstract0_t* abs2 = ap_abstract_top(manoct,3,3);
bool b = ap_abstract0_is_eq(manoct,abs1,abs2);
  /* Problem: the effective function called (octagon_is_eq) expects
     abs1 to be an octagon, and not a polyhedron ! */

ap_abstract0_t* abs3 = ap_abstract_top(manoct,3,3);
abstract0_meet_with(manpk,abs2,abs3);
  /* Problem: the effective function called (pk_meet_with) expects
     abs2 and abs3 to be polyhedra, but they are octagons */
@end example

There is actually no static typing, as @code{abstract0_t*}
and @code{manager_t} are abstract types shared by the different
libraries. Types are thus dynamically checked by the interface.
Notice that the use of @emph{C++} and inheritance would not solve
directly the problem, if functions of the interface are methods of
the manager; one would have:

@example
ap_manager_t* manpk = pk_manager_alloc(true);
  /* manager for Polka, effective type pk_manager_t* */
ap_manager_t* manoct = oct_manager_alloc();
  /* manager for octagon, effective type oct_manager_t* */

ap_abstract0_t* abs1 = manpk->abstract_top(3,3);
  /* effective type: poly_t */
ap_abstract0_t* abs2 = manoct->abstract_top(3,3);
  /* effective type: oct_t */
bool b = manoct->abstract0_is_eq(abs1,abs2);
  /* No static typing possible:
     manpk->abstract0_is_eq and manoct->abstract0_is_eq should have the same
     signature (otherwise one cannot interchange manpk and manoct in the code),
     which means that abs1 and abs2 are supposed to be of type abstract0_t* */
*/
@end example

Currently, only the OCaml polymorphic type system allows to solve
elegantly this problem.

@c ===================================================================
@node OCaml Programming Guidelines, MakingLibrary, C Programming Guidelines, APRON Guidelines
@section OCaml Programming Guidelines
@c ===================================================================

All modules belonging to the APRON interface itself (@code{Scalar},
@code{Interval}, ..., @code{Manager}, @code{Linexpr0},
... @code{Abstract1}) are included in a big encapsulating module named
@code{Apron}. In addition, there are modules like @code{Box}
(intervals), @code{Oct} (octagons), @code{Polka} (linear equalities
and convex polyhedra) and @code{Ppl} (convex polyhedra and linear
congruences) not included in @code{Apron}.

Generic abstract values have the type @code{'a Abstract1.t}, generic
managers the type @code{'a Manager.t}. A typical operation like the
emptiness test has the type @code{val is_bottom : 'a Manager.t -> 'a
Abstract1.t -> bool}.

Octagons of @sc{Octagon} have the type @code{Oct.t
Apron.Abstract1.t}. The corresponding managers have thus the type
@code{Oct.t Manager.t}.

See @uref{../mlapronidl/index.html,OCaml interface} for the

@node MakingLibrary,  , OCaml Programming Guidelines, APRON Guidelines
@section How to make an existing library conformant to APRON ?
@c ===================================================================

We briefly describe here how to connect an existing library to the
common interface.

First, the library has to expose an interface which conforms to the
level 0 of the interface (module @code{abstract0}).  All the functions
described in this module should be defined. If a function is not
really implemented, at least it shoulld contain the code raising the
exception @code{EXC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED}.  The implementor may use any
functions of the files @file{ap_coeff.h}, @file{ap_linexpr0.h},
@file{ap_lincons0.h}, @file{ap_generator0.h} and @file{ap_manager.h}
to help the job of converting datatypes of the interface to internal
datatypes used inside the library.

Second and last, the library should expose an initialization
function that allocates and initializes properly an object of type
@code{manager_t}. For this purpose, the module @code{manager} offers the
utility functions @code{manager_alloc}. As an example, we give the
definition of the function allocating a manager as implemented in
the @emph{NewPolka}.

@enumerate
@item Header of the function:
@example
manager_t* pk_manager_alloc(
  bool strict /* specific parameter: do we allow strict constaints ? */
)
@end example
@item Allocation and initialisation of global data specific to @emph{NewPolka}:
@example
@{
  pk_internal_t* pk = pk_internal_alloc(strict); /* allocation */
  pk_set_approximate_max_coeff_size(pk, 1);
    /* initialization of specific functions
       (not offered in the common interface) */
@}
@end example
@item Allocation of the manager itself:
@example
  manager_t* man = ap_manager_alloc("polka","2.0",
				    pk, (void (*)(void*))pk_internal_free);
@end example
We provide resp. name, version, internal specific manager, and the
function to free it.

The function @code{manager_alloc} sets the options of the
common interface to their default value (see documentation).
@item Initialization of the ``virtual'' table: we need to connect
  the generic functions of the interface (eg, @code{abstract_meet},
  @enddots{}) to the actual functions of the library.
@example
  funptr = man->funptr;

  funptr[fun_minimize] = &poly_minimize;
  funptr[fun_canonicalize] = &poly_canonicalize;
  funptr[fun_hash] = &poly_hash;
  funptr[fun_approximate] = &poly_approximate;
  funptr[fun_fprint] = &poly_fprint;
  funptr[fun_fprintdiff] = &poly_fprintdiff;
  funptr[fun_fdump] = &poly_fdump;
  ...
@end example
@item Last, we return the allocated manager:
@example
  return man;
@}
@end example
@end enumerate
That's all for the implementor side.

@c *******************************************************************
@node Managers and Abstract Domains, Scalars & Intervals & Coefficients, APRON Guidelines, Top
@chapter Managers and Abstract Domains
@c *******************************************************************

APRON makes use of a global manager for:

@itemize
@item
selecting an effective underlying library/abstract domain;
@item
controlling various options;
@item
managing exceptions and flags;
@item
and also managing internal workspace needed for some library.
@end itemize

In a multithreaded program, both managers and abstract values should
not be shared between threads (make copies to transmit information).

Managers are allocated by the underlying libraries/abstract domains, but are freed via an APRON function.

The main functions brought by level 1 are

@itemize
@item
to convert variables to dimensions, thanks to the addition of
environments to objects;
@item
to redimension (abstract values), expressions, constraints and
generators defined on different environments.
@end itemize

The policy for redimensioning is the following one:

@itemize
@item
For functions taking one abstract value and one expression (or
constraint or generator, or array of ...), the environment of the
expression should be a sub-environment of the environment of the
abstract value. The environment of the result is the environment of
the argument abstract value.
@item
For functions taking several abstract values, their environments
should be the same. Otherwise, it is up to the user to move them
to a common super-environment (see @ref{Environments} and
@ref{Change of environments of abstract values of level 1}).
@end itemize

@ifnothtml
For information only (as these types are considered as abstract),
we sum up the involved types below.

@section Variables and related operations (@file{ap_var.h})
@c ===================================================================

A variable is not necessarily a name, it can be a more complex
structured datatype, depending on the application. That is the
motivation to make it a parameter of the interface.

The abstract type @code{ap_var_t} is equipped with a total ordering
function, a hashing function, a copy function, and a free function.
The parametrization of the interface is performed via a global
variable pointing to a @code{ap_var_operations_t} structure,
containing the above-mentione doperations on @code{ap_var_t} objects.
This means that this type should be fixed once, and that in a
multitreaded application all threads should share the same
@code{ap_var_t} type.

By default, @code{ap_var_t} is a C string (@code{char*}), and the
global variable @code{ap_var_operations} is properly initialized.

@deftp datatype ap_var_t
@example
typedef void* ap_var_t;
@end example
Datatype for ``variables''. It is assumed to be of size
@code{sizeof(void*)}.
@end deftp

@deftp datatype ap_var_operations_t
@example
typedef struct ap_var_operations_t @{
  int (*compare)(ap_var_t v1, ap_var_t v2); /* Total ordering function */
  int (*hash)(ap_var_t v);                  /* Hash function */
  ap_var_t (*copy)(ap_var_t var);           /* Duplication function */
  void (*free)(ap_var_t var);               /* Deallocation function */
  char* (*to_string)(ap_var_t var); /* Conversion to a dynamically allocated string,
				       which should be deallocated with free after use */
@} ap_var_operations_t;
@end example
Datatype for defining the operations on ``variables''.
@end deftp

@deftypevar ap_var_operations_t var_operations_default
Default manager, where @code{ap_var_t} is assumed to be @code{char*}.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar ap_var_operations_t* var_operations
Global pointer to the manager in use, by default points to @code{ap_var_operations_default}.
@end deftypevar

@node Environments, Linear expressions of level 1, Variables and related operations, Level 1 of the interface
@section Environments (@file{ap_environment.h})

Environments bind variables (of level 1) to dimensions (of level 0).

@deftp datatype ap_environment_t
Internal datatype for environments.

For information, the definition is:
@example
typedef struct ap_environment_t @{
  ap_var_t* var_of_dim;
  /*
    Array of size intdim+realdim, indexed by dimensions.
    - It should not contain identical strings..
    - Slice [0..intdim-1] is lexicographically sorted,
      and denotes integer variables.
    - Slice [intdim..intdim+realdim-1] is lexicographically sorted,
      and denotes real variables.
    - The memory allocated for the variables are attached to the structure
      (they are freed when the structure is no longer in use)
  */
  size_t intdim; /* Number of integer variables */
  size_t realdim;/* Number of real variables */
  size_t count; /* For reference counting */
@} ap_environment_t;
@end example
@end deftp

@deftypefun void ap_environment_free (ap_environment_t* @var{env})
@deftypefunx ap_environment_t* ap_environment_copy (ap_environment_t* @var{env})
Respectively free and duplicate an environment.

(@code{copy} is cheap, as environments are managed with reference
counters).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void ap_environment_fdump (FILE* @var{stream}, ap_environment_t* @var{env})
Print an environment under the form:
@example
  environment: dim = (..,..), count = ..
  0: name0
  1: name1
  ...
@end example
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_alloc_empty ()
Build an empty environment.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_alloc (ap_var_t* @var{var_of_intdim}, size_t @var{intdim}, ap_var_t* @var{var_of_realdim}, size_t @var{realdim})
Build an environment from an array of integer and an array of real variables.

@var{var_of_intdim} is an array of variables of size @var{intdim},
@var{var_of_realdim} is an array of variables of size
@var{realdim}. Pointers to arrays may be @code{NULL} if their size is
0.

Variables are duplicated in the result, so it is the responsability of
the user to free the variables he provides.

If some variables are duplicated, return @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_add (ap_environment_t* @var{env}, ap_var_t* @var{var_of_intdim}, size_t @var{intdim}, ap_var_t* @var{var_of_realdim}, size_t @var{realdim})
@deftypefunx ap_environment_t* ap_environment_remove (ap_environment_t* @var{env}, ap_var_t* @var{tvar}, size_t @var{size})
Resp. add or remove new variables to an existing environment, with
a functional semantics. Same conventions as for
@code{ap_environment_alloc} function apply. If the result is
non-sense (or in case of attempt to remove an unknwon variable),
return @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_dim_t ap_environment_dim_of_var (ap_environment_t* @var{env}, ap_var_t @var{var})
Convert a variable in its corresponding dimension in the environment @var{env}. If @var{var} is unknown in @var{env}, return @code{AP_DIM_MAX}.
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun ap_dim_t ap_environment_var_of_dim (ap_environment_t* @var{env}, ap_dim_t @var{dim})
Return the variable associated to the dimension @var{dim} in the environment @var{env}. There is no bound check here.
@end deftypefun

The remaining functions are much less useful for normal user.

@deftypefun bool ap_environment_is_eq (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env2})
@deftypefunx bool ap_environment_is_leq (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env2})
Resp. test the equality and the inclusion of two environments.
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun int ap_environment_compare (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env2})
Return:
@table @code
@item -2
if the environments are not compatible (a variable has a different
type in the 2 environments);
@item -1
if @var{env1} is a subset of (included in) @var{env2};
@item 0
if they are equal;
@item +1
if @var{env1} is a superset of @var{env2};
@item +2
otherwise: the least common environment exists and is a strict
superset of both environments.
@end table
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun int ap_environment_hash (ap_environment_t* @var{env})
Return an hash code for an environment.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_dimchange_t* ap_environment_dimchange (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env})
Compute the transformation for converting from an environment
@var{env1} to a superenvironment @var{env}.  Return NULL if @var{env}
is not a superenvironment.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_dimchange2_t* ap_environment_dimchange2 (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env2})
Compute the transformation for switching from an environment
@var{env1} to an @var{env2}, by first adding (some) variables of
@var{env2}, and then removing (some) variables of @var{env1}.  Return
NULL if @var{env1} and @var{env2} ar enot compatible environments.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_lce (ap_environment_t* @var{env1}, ap_environment_t* @var{env2}, ap_dimchange_t** @var{dimchange1}, ap_dimchange_t** @var{dimchange2})
Least common environment to two enviroenments.
@itemize
@item
Assume @code{ap_environment_is_eq(env1,env2)==false}
@item
If environments are not compatible (a variable has different types in
the 2 environments), return NULL
@item
Compute also in @var{dimchange1} and @var{dimchange2} the conversion transformations to the lce.
@item
If no dimensions to add to @var{env1}, this implies that @var{env} is
actually @var{env1}. In this case,
@code{*dimchange1==NULL}. Otherwise, the function allocates the
@code{*dimchange1} with @code{ap_dimchange_alloc}.
@end itemize
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_lce_array (ap_environment_t** @var{tenv}, size_t @var{size}, ap_dimchange_t*** @var{ptdimchange})
Least common environment to an array of environments.
@itemize
@item
Assume the size @var{size} of the array @var{tenv} is at least one;
@item
If all input environments are the same, @code{*ptdimchange==NULL}.
Otherwise, compute in @code{*ptdimchange} the conversion permutations
@item
If no dimensions to add to @code{tenv[i]}, this implies that the
result is actually @code{tenv[i]}. In this case,
@code{(*ptdimchange)[i]==NULL}. Otherwise, the function allocates the
@code{(*ptdimchange)[i]} with @code{ap_dimchange_alloc}.
@end itemize
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ap_environment_t* ap_environment_rename (ap_environment_t* @var{env}, ap_var_t* @var{tvar1}, ap_var_t* @var{tvar2}, size_t @var{size}, ap_dimperm_t* @var{perm})
Rename the variables in the environment.  @var{size} is the common
size of arrays @var{tvar1} and @var{tvar2}, and @var{perm} is a
result-parameter pointing to an @emph{existing but not initialized}
object of type @code{ap_dimperm_t}.

The function applies the variable substitution @code{tvar1[i]->tvar2[i]}
to the environment, and returns the resulting environment and the
allocated transformation permutation in @code{*perm}.

If the parameters are not valid, return @code{NULL} with
@code{perm->dim==NULL}.

@node Linear expressions of level 1, Linear constraints of level 1, Environments, Level 1 of the interface
@section Linear expressions of level 1 (@file{ap_linexpr1.h})
@c ===================================================================

We manipulate here expressions of the form
@quotation
@math{a_0.x_0 + ... + a_n.x_n + b}
@end quotation
where the coefficients @math{a_0, ..., a_n, b} are of
@code{ap_coeff_t} type (either scalars or intervals) and the variables
@math{x_0, ... , x_n} are of type @code{ap_var_t}.

The semantics of linear expressions is exact, in the sense that the
arithmetic operations are interpreted in the real (or rational)
numbers. However, abstract domains are free to overapproximate this
exact semantics (this may occur when converting rational scalars to
@code{double} type for instance).

A special remark concerns integer variables. Abstract domains are
assumed to perform the operations involving linear expressions using a
real/rational semantics, and then possibly to reduce the result using
the knowledge that integer variables may only take integer
values.
@quotation
This semantics @emph{coincides} with the natural integer semantics of
expressions involving only integer variables @emph{only if} the
involved coefficients are all integers.
@end quotation
@quotation
A typical counter-example to this is an assignement @math{y := 1/3 x} where
@math{x} and @math{y} are integer variables. If this assignement is
applied to the @sc{Box} abstract domain value @math{x in [1;1]}, it
may lead to the bottom value, because one will first obtain @math{y in
[1/3;1/3]} by real/rational computations, and this may be reduced to
the empty interval because @math{y} is integer and the interval
contains no integer values.
@end quotation

If you need expressions with a less simple semantics (mixing integer,
real/rational and floating-point semantics with casts), you should use
tree expressions (@pxref{Tree expressions of level 1}).

@deftp datatype ap_linexpr1_t
(Internal) type of interval linear expressions.

Linear expressions of level 1 are created as objects of type
@code{ap_linexpr1_t}, not as pointers of type @code{ap_linexpr1_t*}.

of type @code{ap_coefftag_t}, each followed by a number of arguments
as specified in the definition of the type @code{ap_coefftag_t}
(@pxref{Access to linear expressions of level 0}). The list should end
with the tag @code{AP_COEFF_END}. The only difference with level 0 is that variables replace dimensions in the list.

Return @code{true} in case @code{ap_linexpr1_coeffref (e,dim)}
returns NULL for one of the variables involved.

Here is a typical example, in the case where @code{ap_var_t} is actually @code{char*} (the default):
@example
ap_linexpr1_set_list(e,
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT, 3, "x",
		     AP_COEFF_S_FRAC, 3,2, "y",
		     AP_COEFF_S_DOUBLE, 4.1, "z",
		     AP_CST_I_DOUBLE, -2.4, 3.6,
		     AP_END); /* Do not forget the last tatg ! */
@end example
which transforms an null expression into @code{3 x + 3/2 y + 4.1 z + [-2.4,3.6]}
and is equivalent to:
@example
ap_linexpr1_set_coeff_scalar_int(e, "x", 3);
ap_linexpr1_set_coeff_scalar_frac(e, "y", 3,2);
ap_linexpr1_set_coeff_scalar_double(e, "z", 4.1);

Most operations are offered in 2 versions: @emph{functional} or
@emph{destructive} @xref{Abstract values and operations of level 0}.

We remind the policy for redimensioning (@pxref{Level 1 of the interface}):

@itemize
@item
For functions taking one abstract value and one expression (or
constraint or generator, or array of ...), the environment of the
expression should be a sub-environment of the environment of the
abstract value. The environment of the result is the environment of
the argument abstract value.
@item
For functions taking several abstract values, their environments
should be the same. Otherwise, it is up to the user to move them to a
common super-environment (@pxref{Environments}).

@deftp datatype ap_dim_t
@example
typedef unsigned int ap_dim_t;
@end example
Datatype for dimensions.
@end deftp

@defmac AP_DIM_MAX
Special value used for sparse representations, means: "to be
ignored". Also used as a result when an error occurs.
@end defmac

@deftp datatype ap_dimension_t
@example
typedef struct ap_dimension_t @{
  size_t intdim;  /* Number of integer dimensions */
  size_t realdim; /* Number of real dimensions */
@} ap_dimension_t;
@end example
Datatype for specifying the dimensionality of an abstract value.
@end deftp

@deftp datatype ap_dimchange_t
@example
typedef struct ap_dimchange_t @{
  ap_dim_t* dim;  /* Assumed to be an array of size intdim+realdim */
  size_t intdim ; /* Number of integer dimensions to add/remove */
  size_t realdim; /* Number of real dimensions to add/remove */
@} ap_dimchange_t;
@end example
Datatype for specifying change of dimension.

The semantics is the following:
@table @strong
@item Addition of dimensions

@code{dimchange.dim[k]} means: add one dimension at dimension k
and shift the already existing dimensions greater than or equal to
@code{k} one step on the right (or increment them).

if @code{k} is equal to the size of the vector, then it means: add
a dimension at the end.

Repetion are allowed, and means that one inserts more than one dimensions.

Example: @code{linexpr0_add_dimensions([i0 i1 r0 r1], @{ [0 1 2 2
4],3,1 @})} returns @code{[0 i0 0 i1 0 0 r0 r1 0]}, considered as
a vector with 5 integer dimensions and 4 real dimensions.

@item Removal of dimensions

@code{dimchange.dim[k]}: remove the dimension @code{k} and shift
the dimensions greater than @code{k} one step on the left (or
decrement them).

Repetitions are meaningless (and are not correct specification).

Example: @code{linexpr0_remove_dimensions([i0 i1 i2 r0 r1 r2], @{
[0 2 4],2,1 @})} returns @code{[i1 r0 r2]}, considered as a vector with 1
integer dimensions and 2 real dimensions.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp datatype ap_dimchange2_t
@example
typedef struct ap_dimchange_2t @{
  ap_dimchange_t* add;    /* If not NULL, specifies the adding new dimensions */
  ap_dimchange_t* remove; /* If not NULL, specifies the removal of dimensions */
@} ap_dimchange2_t;
@end example
Datatype for specifying a transformation composed of the addition and
the removal of dimensions. Used by functions
@code{ap_abstract0_apply_dimchange2},
@code{ap_environment_dimchange2}, and
@code{ap_abstract1_change_environment.}.
@end deftp

@deftp datatype ap_dimperm_t
@example
typedef struct ap_dimperm_t @{
  ap_dim_t* dim; /* Array assumed to be of size size */
  size_t size;
@} ap_dimperm_t;
@end example
Datatype for permutations.

Represents the permutation @code{i -> dimperm.p[i]} for
@code{0<=i<dimperm.size}.

@deftypefun bool ap_linexpr0_set_list (ap_linexpr0_t* @var{e}, ...)
This function assign the linear expression @var{E} from a list of
tags of type @code{ap_coefftag_t}, each followed by a number of
arguments as specified in the definition of the tye
@code{ap_coefftag_t}. The list should end with the tag
@code{AP_COEFF_END}.

Return @code{true} in case @code{ap_linexpr0_coeffref(e,dim)}
returns NULL for one of the dimensions involved.

Here is a typical example:
@example
ap_linexpr0_set_list(e,
		     AP_COEFF_S_INT, 3, 0,
		     AP_COEFF_S_FRAC, 3,2, 1,
		     AP_COEFF_S_DOUBLE, 4.1, 2,
		     AP_CST_I_DOUBLE, -2.4, 3.6,
		     AP_END); /* Do not forget the last tatg ! */
@end example
which transforms an null expression into @code{3 x0 + 3/2 x1 + 4.1 x2 + [-2.4,3.6]}
and is equivalent to:
@example
ap_linexpr0_set_coeff_scalar_int(e,0, 3);
ap_linexpr0_set_coeff_scalar_frac(e,1, 3,2);
ap_linexpr0_set_coeff_scalar_double(e,2, 4.1);

@var{destructive} controls the behaviour of the functionn:

@itemize
@item
In the @emph{destructive semantics}, after the call the
first abstract value in the arguments of the function is destroyed and
should not be referenced any more. Although the returned value might
actually be equal to the (destroyed) argument, the user just
manipulates the returned value and never refers directly to the
(destroyed) argument.
@item
In the @emph{functional semantics}, the first abstract value in the

The signatures and documentation of these functions are
provided by the files @file{ap_generic.h},
@file{ap_linearize.h} and @file{ap_reducedproduct.h}.

These functions are dedicated to implementors of underlying
libraries. They offer generic default implementations for some of
the operations required by the APRON API, when there is no more
specific and efficient implementation for the domain being
implemented.

To use one of these, the function allocating manager, which is
specific to the domain, should put the corresponding pointer in
the virtual table to such a generic implementation.

They manipulated "unboxed" abstract values, which are native to
the underlying library: they are not yet boxed with the manager in
the type @code{ap_abstract0_t}.
