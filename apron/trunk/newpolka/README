This package is a convex polyhedra library that conforms to the APRON
interface. It requires APRON package.

It includes both the C interface and the OCaml interface to APRON.

Examples of use via the interface can be found in test0.c, test1.c, and
test.ml.

REQUIREMENTS
============
For the C interface:

GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
ITV and NUM libraries
APRON library

For the OCaml interface, in addition:
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)
MLGMPIDL package
MLAPRONIDL package

INSTALLATION
============

Set the file Makefile.config to your own setting.
You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

1. C Library
----------

type 'make', and then 'make install' 

The library is named libpolkaRl.a, libpolkaRll.a or libpolkaMPQ.a (and
libpolkaRl_debug.a, ...).

i, l, g, stands for long int, long long int, and gmp, which
indicates the underlying representation of integers.

For use via APRON, the include files to consider is pk.h

When linking, requires resp. libitvlr.a (i), libitvllr.a (l), libitvmpq.a (g)
plus libraries required by APRON.

2. OCaml Library
----------------

type 'make ml', and then 'make install' 

The C part of the library is named libpolkaXX_caml.a or
libpolkaXX_caml.so/dllpolkaXX_caml.so (and libpolkaXX_caml_debug.a or ...).

The OCaml part is named polkaXX.cma (polkaXX.cmxa)

3. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.
