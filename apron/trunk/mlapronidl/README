This package is an OCAML interface for the APRON library/interface.

The interface is accessed via the Apron module, which is decomposed into 15
submodules, corresponding to C modules:

Scalar     : scalars (numbers)     
Interval   : intervals on scalars 
Coeff      : coefficients (either scalars or intervals)
Dimension  : dimensions and related operations
Linexpr0   : (interval) linear expressions, level 0
Lincons0   : (interval) linear constraints, level 0
Generator0 : generators, level 0
Texpr0     : tree expressions, level 0
Tcons0     : tree constraints, level 0
Manager    : managers
Abstract0: : abstract values, level 0
Var        : variables 
Environment: environment binding variables to dimensions
Linexpr1   : (interval) linear expressions, level 1
Lincons1   : interval) linear constraints, level 1
Generator1 : generators, level 1
Texpr0     : tree expressions, level 1
Tcons0     : tree constraints, level 1
Abstract1  : abstract values, level 1
Parser     : parsing of expressions, constraints and generators

REQUIREMENTS
============
APRON library
GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
MPFR library (tested with version 2.2 and up)
mlgmpidl package (included)
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)

INSTALLATION
============

1. Library
----------
Set the file Makefile.config to your own setting.
You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

type 'make', and then 'make install'

The OCaml part of the library is named apron.cma (.cmxa, .a)
The C part of the library is named libapron_caml.a or dllapron_caml.so (libapron_caml_debug.a or ...)

'make install' installs not only .mli, .cmi, but also .idl files.

2. Documentation
----------------

The documentation is generated with ocamldoc.

'make mlapronidl.pdf'
'make html' (put the HTML files in the html subdirectoy)

3. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.

COMPILATION AND LINKING
=======================

To make things clearer, we assume an example file 'mlexample.ml' which uses both
NewPolka (convex polyhedra) and Box (intervals) libraries, in their versions
where numbers are GMP rationals (the default). We assume
that C and OCaml interface and library files are located in directory
$APRON/lib.

The native-code compilation command looks like

ocamlopt -I $MLGMPIDL/lib -I $APRON/lib -o mlexample.opt bigarray.cmxa gmp.cmxa apron.cmxa boxMPFR.cmxa polkaMPQ.cmxa mlexample.ml

Comments:

1. You need at least the libraries 'bigarray' (standard OCaml
  distribution), 'gmp', and 'apron' (standard APRON distribution),
  plus the one implementing an effective abstract domains: here,
  'boxMPFR', and 'polkaMPQ'.

2. The C libraries associated to those OCaml libraries
  ('gmp_caml', 'box_caml', ...)  are automatically looked for.

If dynamic libraries are available (HAS_SHARED variable in Makefile.config), the byte-code compilation process looks the same:

ocamlc -I $MLGMPIDL/lib -I $APRON/lib -o mlexample.byte bigarray.cma gmp.cma apron.cma boxMPFR.cma polkaMPQ.cma mlexample.ml

Otherwise, either
1. add the '-custom' option on the command-line above
2. or use a cusrtom runtime interprer:

   ocamlc -I $APRON/lib -make-runtime -o myrun bigarray.cma gmp.cma apron.cma boxMPFR.cma polkaMPQ.cma 
 
  ocamlc -I $APRON/lib -use-runtime myrun -o mlexample.byte bigarray.cma gmp.cma apron.cma box.cma polka.cma mlexample.ml

  Comments:
  a. One first build a custom bytecode interpreter that includes the
     new native-code needed;
  b. One then compile the 'mlexample.ml' file.

The option '-verbose' helps to understand what is happening in
case of problem.

See the pdf or html documentations for more details.
