For the C interface:

GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
MPFR library (tested with version 2.2.0 and up)
NUM "library" (a set of header files)

Camlidl (tested with 1.05)
MLGMPIDL package
MLAPRONIDL package

INSTALLATION

----------

type 'make', and then 'make install' 

The library is named libap_pkgrid.a (and
libap_pkgrid_debug.a). 

For use via APRON, the include files to consider is ap_pkgrid.h.

2. OCaml Library
----------------

type 'make ml', and then 'make install' 

The C part of the library is named libpolkaGrid_caml.a or
libpolkaGrid_caml.so/dllpolkaGrid_caml.so (and libpolkaGrid_caml_debug.a or ...).

The OCaml part is named polkaGrid.cma (polkaGrid.cmxa)

3. Miscellaneous
----------------
