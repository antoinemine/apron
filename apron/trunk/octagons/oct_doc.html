<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr//">APRON</a> project provides a
common interface for various numerical abstract domains with various
expressiveness and cost versus precision trade-offs.
This document describes the octagon domain implementation available
within APRON.
The octagon domain allows manipulating and representing conjunctions
of invariants of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &plusmn;<i>y</i> &le; <i>c</i>, where <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> range among a finite set of numerical program variables.
In two dimensions, such invariants have an octagonal shape, hence the name.

<p>
Familiarity is assumed with the generic APRON framework as well as
the octagon abstract domain (see <a href="#links">external links</a>).

<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
Please see the <code>README</code> file included in the
distribution for installation instructions.


<h2><a name="c">Access to the Library from C and C++</a></h2>

<p>
Your C or C++ program must be linked with the following libraries:
<ul>
<li> the octagon library <code>-loctX</code>
(where <code>X</code> denotes the chosen numeric set;
<code>MPQ</code> for instance);
<li> the APRON library <code>-lapron</code>;
<li> the GMP library <code>-lgmp</code>;
<li> the MPFR library <code>-lmpfr</code>;
<li> the standard mathematical library <code>-lm</code>.
</ul>
It is possible to use additional libraries, such as the POLKA module
<code>-lpolkaMPQ</code>.

<p>
The standard way to access to the octagon library is through an
APRON manager. The manager is created as follows:
<ul>
<li>include the <code>oct.h</code> file,
<li>create an octagon manager 
<code>ap_manager_t* man = oct_manager_alloc();</code>
</ul>
All standard APRON functions from <code>ap_abstract0.h</code>
are available on octagons through <code>man</code>.

<p>
Note that, when using a floating-point implementation of the octagon library,
creating a manager will automatically put the floating-point unit into
<i>rounding towards +oo</i> mode
(using <code>ap_fpu_init</code> provided by APRON), 
as it is required to ensure the soundness of the transfer functions.
Beware that this setting is global: it affects all the computations of the
process, not only those occurring in the octagon library.


<h2><a name="numeric">Underlying Numeric Set</a></h2>

<p>
The octagon library is compiled with a variety of underlying numeric set,
distinguished using a suffix:
<ul>
<li> <code>I</code>: integers with a plain "long int" representation;
<li> <code>Ill</code>: integers with a "long long int" representation;
<li> <code>MPZ</code>: arbitrary precision integers using GMP;
<li> <code>Rl</code>: rationals with a "long int" representation;
<li> <code>Rll</code>: rationals with a "long long int" representation;
<li> <code>MPQ</code>: arbitrary precision rationals using GMP;
<li> <code>D</code>: reals with a "double" representation;
<li> <code>Dl</code>:   reals with a "long double" representation.
</ul>

<p>
The choice of this numeric set affects the soundness, precision, and
efficiency of the analysis:
<ul>
<li> <code>int</code> and <code>long</code> types are subject to overflows,
which may result in unsound results 
(no overflow checking is performed for efficiency reasons),
<li> <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code> types are subject to 
rounding, which may result in some loss of precision; 
rounding is always performed towards +oo, which ensures soundness;
<li> abstract transfer functions are inherently incomplete in
<code>Z</code>, which results in some loss of precision;
<li> constraints on reals are soundly approximated when
using numbers in <code>Z</code>,
<li> <code>GMP</code> types are much slower than native types.
</ul>
For best precision, <code>MPQ</code> is recommended.
For a fast and versatile yet sound analysis, <code>D</code> 
is recommended.

<p>
Note that the underlying numeric set chosen for octagons is not
related to the choice of <code>double</code> or <code>GMP</code> for
<code>ap_scalar_t</code> types used as arguments in transfer functions.
Type mismatches may result in extra over-approximation (but always in a
sound way).



<h2><a name="transfer">Precision of the Transfer Functions</a></h2>

<p>
Exact transfer functions are provided for the class of operations that
are closed under octagons.
These include:
<ul>
<li> conjunctions with or conversions from constraints of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &plusmn;<i>y</i> &le; <i>c</i> 
or
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &le; <i>c</i>,
<li> (possibly parallel)
assignments and substitutions of expressions of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> + <i>[a,b]</i> or <i>[a,b]</i>,
<li> meets (<i>i.e.</i>, intersections) of octagons,
<li> getting the bound of a dimension or an expression of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &plusmn;<i>y</i> + <i>[a,b]</i>,
&plusmn;<i>x</i> + <i>[a,b]</i>, or <i>[a,b]</i>,
<li> conversions to constraint sets,
<li> conversions from boxes,
<li> variable additions, deletions, projections, permutations, and expansions,
<li> topological closures (always identity),
<li> serializations and de-serializations.
</ul>

<p>
Best transfer functions are provided in the following cases:
<ul> 
<li> join (<i>i.e.</i>, union) of octagons,
<li> addition of rays,
<li> conversions from generator sets,
<li> conversions to boxes,
<li> variable folding.
</ul>

<p>
The following transfer functions use some approximate polynomial algorithms
and have no precision guarantees:
<ul>
<li> conversions from or conjunctions with arbitrary constraints
(a weakly relational approximation is used),
<li> (possibly parallel) assignments and substitutions of arbitrary expressions
(a weakly relational approximation is used),
<li> conversions to generator sets (the whole universe is always returned),
<li> getting the bound of arbitrary expressions
(interval arithmetics is used).
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, the exactness or best-precision feature of an abstract transfer
function is often lost when the <code>MPQ</code> underlying numeric set
is not used, or the arguments have integer dimensions, or the user sets
the <code>algorithm</code> parameter to a strictly negative value.
Finally, the exactness or best-precision feature can be lost due to
conversion between the underlying numeric type and 
user-provided <code>ap_scalar_t</code> types.
The octagon library will set the <code>flag_exact</code> and
<code>flag_best</code> manager flags accordingly in all cases.

<p>
Note that, due to interval coefficients, expressions may be non-deterministic, 
that is, correspond to a bunch of expressions.
In case of assignments, substitutions, or bound determinations of 
non-deterministic 
expressions, or conjunctions with non-deterministic constraints, 
we considers the <i>join</i> of all results, when ranging over the 
non-deterministic set.



<h2><a name="predicate">Precision of the Predicates</a></h2>

<p>
The following predicates are exact, <i>i.e.</i>, they always return
either <code>tbool_true</code> or <code>tbool_false</code> 
(provided that <code>algorithm</code> is greater than or equal to 0,
that the octagon has no integer dimension, and that the 
<code>MPQ</code> underlying domain is selected):
<ul>
<li> testing for inclusion, equality, emptiness, or universality,
<li> testing whether a dimension is unbounded or saturated by a
given interval,
<li> testing for saturation by an expression of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &plusmn;<i>y</i> + <i>[a,b]</i>,
&plusmn;<i>x</i> + <i>[a,b]</i>, or <i>[a,b]</i>.
</ul>

<p>
Note that, for non-deterministic expressions, <code>tbool_false</code> is 
returned as long as the saturation is not satisfied for at least one expression.

<p>
Testing for the saturation by an arbitrary expression is very imprecise.
It always return <code>tbool_top</code>.

<p>
When <code>algorithm</code> is set to a strictly negative value, the
octagon has an integer dimension, the <code>MPQ</code> underlying domain is 
selected, or the conversion from user-specified <code>ap_scalar_t</code> types
to internal types resulted in an over-approximation, the predicate is sound
but not exact: it is a <i>semi-test</i>.
That is, it mainly returns either
<code>tbool_true</code> or <code>tbool_top</code>.
It can conclude that the predicate is definitively <code>tbool_false</code>
only in very rare cases.
The octagon library will set the <code>flag_exact</code> and
<code>flag_best</code> manager flags accordingly in all cases.





<h2><a name="algorithm">The algorithm parameter</a></h2>

<p>
The <code>algorithm</code> field in the manager provides an 
implementation-specific parameter to set the required level of precision
for transfer functions.

<p>
In the octagon domain, only two precision levels are recognised.
They correspond to (with the exception of the widening):
<ul>
<li> <code>algorithm &ge; 0</code> is the normal precision:
a transitive closure algorithm is used pervasively to achieve
best precision transfer functions and results in transfer functions that
have a cubic worst-case cost (in the number of variables),
<li> <code>algorithm < 0</code> is the low precision: the transitive closure
algorithm is not used, the best precision feature is not guaranteed, and
transfer functions have a quadratic worst-case cost
(many actually have a linear cost).
</ul>


<h2><a name="widening">Widenings and Narrowing</a></h2>

<p>
Depending on the <code>algorithm</code> flag, one of the following widening
algorithm is used:
<ul>
<li> <code>algorithm = 0</code>:
the right argument is closed, the standard widening is used: unstable 
constraints are forgotten.
Thus, it converges in a quadratic number of steps, at worse.
<li> <code>algorithm &lt; 0</code>:
the standard widening algorithm is used but the right argument is not closed.
<li> <code>algorithm = oct_pre_widening</code>:
this special value corresponds to a <i>pre-widening</i>.
It does not enforce the convergence by itself but can be safely intermixed
with a regular widening to improve the precision of the sequence, without
jeopardizing the overall convergence. As long as a regular widening is
applied infinitely often, the sequence will converge in finite time.
(Note that intermixing a regular widening with a join operator will result
in a diverging sequence. Thus, the join is not a pre-widening.
Our pre-widening is actually a join without the closure application.)
Use with care!
</ul>

<p>
The <code>ap_abstract0_oct_widening_thresholds</code> provides a widening
with scalar thresholds. 
For each constraint of the form
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &plusmn;<i>y</i> &le; <i>c</i> or 
&plusmn;<i>x</i> &le; <i>c</i> where the bound <i>c</i> is not stable,
the widening replaces <i>c</i> with the scalar immediately greater in
the user-supplied list, or +oo if it is greater than the greatest supplied
scalar.
The list must be sorted in strictly increasing order.
(Note that this operator is not exactly the same as the generic
<code>ap_abstract0_widening_threshold</code> function which is synthesized
from <code>ap_abstract0_sat_lincons</code> and
<code>ap_abstract0_meet_lincons_array</code>.)

<p>
The <code>ap_abstract0_oct_narrowing</code> function implements the
standard narrowing: it refines only those constraints that have
no finite bound.
Thus, it converges in a quadratic number of steps, at worse.


<h2><a name="extra">Additional Transfer Functions</a></h2>

<p>
The octagon library provides a few functions not generic enough to be
included in the APRON library.
They share the <code>ap_abstract0_oct_</code> prefix.

<p>
Additionally to the widening with thresholds and narrowing functions
described in the preceding section, the octagon domain provides the following
extra function:
<ul>
<li> <code>ap_abstract0_oct_of_generator_array</code> converts a
generator set to an octagon, with best-precision.
<li> <code>ap_abstract0_oct_add_epsilon</code> enlarges each constraint bound
by a user-specified factor of the maximum finite bound present in the
octagon.
</ul>



<h2><a name="unimplemented">Unimplemented Features</a></h2>

<p>
The following are not implemented and will raise an
exception:
<ul>
<li> all the functions related to minimal and canonical forms,
<li> <code>ap_abstract0_approximate</code>.
</ul>


<h2><a name="poly">Conversion with Polyhedra</a></h2>

<p>
In order to ensure the best precision, the following conversion procedures
are recommended:
<ul>
<li> To convert a polyhedron to an octagon, call
<code>ap_abstract0_to_generator_array</code> on the polyhedra and then
<code>ap_abstract0_oct_of_generator_array</code> on the result.
<li> To convert an octagon to a polyhedron, call
<code>ap_abstract0_to_lincons_array</code> on the octagon and then
<code>ap_abstract0_of_lincons_array</code> on the result.
</ul>

<p>
Do not extract the generators of an octagon or build an octagon from
arbitrary linear constraints as these are not best-precision operators.


<h2><a name="tools">Tools</a></h2>

<p>
The distribution provides a fully automatic test suite with
<code>octtest</code>.
It compares the result of all transfer functions in the octagon and polyhedron
domains, checking for soundness, best-precision and exactness properties.



<h2><a name="low">Low-level Access</a></h2>

<p>
The file <code>oct/oct_fun.h</code> provides a direct access to all the
octagon functions, without the abstraction provided by the manager.
Note that these functions perform less sanity checks, and so, may not be
as safe.
Wrapping and unwrapping a <code>oct_t*</code> pointer within a
generic <code>ap_abstract0_t*</code> is done using the
<code>abstract0_of_oct</code> and <code>oct_of_abstract0</code> functions.

<p>
The file <code>oct/oct_internal.h</code> must be included to access to the
low-level representation of octagons 
<code>struct oct_t</code> and manager-specific data
<code>struct _oct_internal_t</code>.
Direct access to private fields is not recommended.


<h2><a name="ocaml">Access to the Library from OCaml</a></h2>

<p>
Your OCaml program must be linked with the following modules, in order:
<ul>
<li> the GMP OCaml wrapper: <code>gmp.cmxa</code>
(or <code>gmp.cma</code> for byte-code);
<li> the APRON OCaml wrapper: <code>apron.cmxa</code>
(or <code>apron.cma</code> for byte-code);
<li> the octagon OCaml wrapper: <code>oct.cmxa</code>
(or <code>oct.cma</code> for byte-code);
<li> the C octagon library for the chosen numerical type, <i>e.g.</i>,
<code>-cclib -loctMPQ</code>;
<li> the C apron library: <code>-cclib -lapron</code>.
</ul>
You may need the specify the include path with <code>-I</code>, depending
on your installation.

<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>
<code>ocamlc -I $HOME/lib gmp.cma apron.cma oct.cma mltest.ml -cclib -loctMPQ -cclib -lapron</code>
<li>
<code>ocamlopt -I $HOME/lib gmp.cmxa apron.cmxa oct.cmxa mltest.ml -cclib -loctMPQ -cclib -lapron</code>
</ul>


<p>
The octagon library provides an <code>Oct</code> OCaml module
There is no numeric suffix here: the OCaml wrapper is independent from the
chosen numerical type.
The <code>Oct.manager_alloc</code> function returns a new manager that can 
then be used with the standard <code>Apron.Abstract0</code> module provided by 
APRON.

<p>
The <code>Oct</code> module also provides some implementation-specific functions:
<ul>
<li> <code>of_generator_array</code> to convert from a set of generators to
an octagon, with best abstraction,
<li> the <code>widening_thresholds</code> widening,
<li> the <code>narrowing</code> standard narrowing,
<li> the <code>add_epsilon</code> perturbation function.
</ul>
