This package is a interval library/abstract domain that conforms to the APRON
interface. It requires APRON package.

It includes both the C interface and the OCaml interface to APRON.


REQUIREMENTS
============
For the C interface:

GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
NUM "library" (a set of header files)
ITV library 
APRON library

For the OCaml interface, in addition:
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)
MLGMPIDL package
MLAPRONIDL package

INSTALLATION
============

Set the file Makefile.config to your own setting.
You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

1. C Library
----------

type 'make', and then 'make install' 

The library is named libboxMPQ.a, libboxRll.a, libboxD.a (and
libboxMPQ_debug.a, ...). 

MPQ, Rll, D, stands for mpq_t, rationals on long long int, and double, which
indicates the underlying representation of numbers.

For use via APRON, the include files to consider is box.h.

When linking, libboxXXX.a requires libapron.a

2. OCaml Library
----------------

type 'make ml', and then 'make install' 

The C part of the library is named libboxXX_caml.a or
libboxXX_caml.so/dllboxXX_caml.so (and libboxXX_caml_debug.a or ...).

The OCaml part is named boxXX.cma (boxXX.cmxa)

3. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.
