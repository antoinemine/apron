This package provides a Java binding for the Apron library.
This includes Apron API objects (expression, constraints, etc.) as well as 
manager factories for the numerical abstract domains included in the
Apron distribution.
Also included is a Java binding for the GMP and MPFR libraries used by Apron.


STATUS
######

Status: Beta
All functions have been implemented but only very few have 
been tested so far.

Requirements: 
Only tested on Sun's Java 1.6.0_17, on x86_64 Linux


INSTALLATION
############

In order to compile, you must set HAS_JAVA to 1 in the global Makefile.config
and type "make" from the Apron main directory.
You must also set-up Java-specific binary names and directories your
Makefile.config.
In particular, you will probably need to set the JNIINC variable to provide
the -I to include jni.h.

"make" builds classfiles and .jar, and .so glue C libraries

"make install" installs the .so, but not classfiles nor .jar

"make doc" builds some Javadoc documentation 

To run some tests, type
  java -ae gmp.Test
  java -ae apron.Test
after checking that your CLASSPATH contains the proper directories.

The PPL binding is optional. It is built only if HAS_PPL is 1.
Currently, 

Currently, whether to compile a double, MPQ, or MPFR of boxes and
octagons is hardcoded in the Makefile.


DOCUMENTATION
#############

For information on the API, type "make doc" and look in the doc/ subdirectory.
