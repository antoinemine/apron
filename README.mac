This document tries to explain some specific points in compiling Apron under
Macintosh. It brings additional information compared to the README.

Note that this is work-in-progress.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- GNU sed is required, instead of standard sed.

- gcc 4.0.1 is reported to cause this problem at the end of the compilation
  process:

  ld: duplicate symbol ___gmpz_abs in ...

  more recent versions should work properly.

The following Cygwin package are required:
- gcc (Devel)
- make (Devel)
- gmp, mpfr (Math)
- doxygen (Devel)
- tetex-base (Publishing)

Additionally, you'll need to install manually the following

- OCaml 3.09 or better, from http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.fr.html
  (the 3.08 version, in CygWin, at the time of writing is too old)

- CamlIDL, from http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/camlidl/


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Copy Makefile.config.model into Makefile.config and edit the _PREFIX paths to
suit your installation (you might want to set APRON_PREFIX, CAMLIDL_PREFIX
and CAML_PREFIX to /usr/local instead of the default /usr).

The following options should be disabled:
- HAS_CPP (Cygwin's gcc is too old)
- HAS_PPL (Apron with PPL compilation untested under Windows)
- HAS_LONG_DOUBLE (long double not supported by math library under Windows)

Do the same with mlgmpidl/Makefile.config.model

Now, (make rebuild), make and make install in the apron top-level directory
should work.
